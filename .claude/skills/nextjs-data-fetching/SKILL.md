description: Use when reading data in a Next.js 16 App Router app — when about to call a Server Action from a Client Component to load data, when about to add a useEffect at all, when seeing useState+useEffect+fetch in a "use client" component, or when adding a `"use server"` function whose only job is to SELECT/read. Pairs with the no-use-effect skill — useEffect is never recommended here.

# Next.js 16 Data Fetching — Server Components, not Server Actions in useEffect

## Scope — Next.js 16 App Router only

This skill applies **only to Next.js 16 App Router projects**. Before applying any rule below, confirm the target codebase actually is one:

- `package.json` has `"next": "^16…"` (or a 16.x range / git ref resolving to 16) **and**
- routes live under `app/` (App Router), not `pages/` (Pages Router).

**If the project is anything else, refuse to apply this skill** and say so explicitly:

- Pages Router (`pages/` directory) — different mental model: `getServerSideProps` / `getStaticProps` / API routes / SWR. The Server Component / Server Action / `revalidatePath` machinery does not exist there. Do not apply.
- Next.js 15 or earlier — APIs and defaults differ; `searchParams` is sync, `refresh()` is not in `next/cache`, cache semantics changed. Do not apply.
- Any other framework (Remix, SvelteKit, Astro, Vite + React, RedwoodJS, plain React, etc.) — the entire premise (RSC + Server Actions) doesn't transfer. Do not apply.
- Mixed monorepo where some apps are 16/App-Router and some aren't — apply only inside the matching app directory.

State the mismatch plainly ("This file is in `pages/`, so the `nextjs-data-fetching` skill doesn't apply — Pages Router uses different primitives") and stop. Don't translate the patterns to a foreign framework.

## Companion skill — install and follow `no-use-effect`

This skill **never recommends `useEffect`**. Every code path here either avoids it entirely or routes through the project's `useMountEffect` helper. If you don't already have it, install the `no-use-effect` skill alongside this one — it owns the broader React-side rule (derive state, use a query library, use event handlers, use `key` to reset, use `useMountEffect` for one-time external sync) and it owns the lint rule (`no-restricted-syntax` banning bare `useEffect`).

If you find a green example below that _looks_ like it would have been a `useEffect` in older code, that's the point — it isn't one anymore. The `❌` red blocks below show `useEffect` only because that's what the anti-pattern actually looks like in the wild; never copy from a red block.

## The Rule

**Read data in Server Components. Mutate data with Server Actions. Never use `useEffect` (or `useState + useEffect`) in a Client Component to call a Server Action just to load data.**

This applies to every Next.js 16 App Router project, including `apps/manager/`. Violating it costs streaming, caching, request deduping, and turns one render into a sequential client-side waterfall.

**Violating the letter of this rule is violating the spirit.** The framework lets you call a `"use server"` function from a Client Component — that's a capability, not a license. The signal that you've drifted is not a runtime error (there is none), it's the patterns below: a `getX` action, a `useEffect` that fetches, a page newly converted to `"use client"`. **The bug is silent: no error, no warning, just worse UX, wasted POSTs, no streaming, no cache.** The absence of a stack trace is not the absence of a problem.

## Why

Per the official Next.js docs:

> "Server Functions are designed for server-side **mutations**, and the client currently dispatches and awaits them **one at a time**. […] If you need parallel data fetching, use data fetching in Server Components."
> — `docs/01-app/01-getting-started/07-mutating-data.mdx`

> "Server Actions are queued, and using them for data fetching introduces sequential execution."
> — `docs/01-app/02-guides/backend-for-frontend.mdx`

Concretely, a `useEffect`-driven Server Action read costs you:

- **No SSR** — the page paints empty, then fetches after hydration. Worst LCP.
- **Sequential queue** — every Server Action call waits on the previous one. No parallelism.
- **No request deduping / caching** — Server Actions always POST; React's request cache, `fetch` cache, and `unstable_cache` don't apply.
- **No streaming** — you can't progressively render with `<Suspense>`.
- **Double-fetch on mount** in Strict Mode dev.
- **Larger client bundle** — fetch logic, loading states, error states all ship to the browser.

## Decision: how to load data

The first question is **not** "where does the data need to land?" — it's "**why is this a Client Component at all?**" Most reads belong on the server. If the answer is anything weaker than "polling, focus refetch, or a third party mutates the data without user intent," the fix is to lift the read to a Server Component, not to swap the transport.

```dot
digraph data_fetching {
  "Why is this a Client Component?" [shape=diamond];
  "Server Component, await directly" [shape=box];
  "URL searchParams; page stays Server Component" [shape=box];
  "Promise<T> from Server Component, use() in Client leaf" [shape=box];
  "Route Handler GET + SWR / React Query (last resort)" [shape=box];

  "Why is this a Client Component?" -> "Server Component, await directly" [label="It isn't / shouldn't be"];
  "Why is this a Client Component?" -> "URL searchParams; page stays Server Component" [label="Filter / tab / range state"];
  "Why is this a Client Component?" -> "Promise<T> from Server Component, use() in Client leaf" [label="Genuine interactivity at the data boundary, initial data only"];
  "Why is this a Client Component?" -> "Route Handler GET + SWR / React Query (last resort)" [label="Polling, focus refetch, or third-party mutates the data"];
}
```

**The branches are not peers.** Top to bottom: Server Component (default, ~90% of cases), URL state (most "I need filters" cases), `use()` + `<Suspense>` (rare — Client Component genuinely needs data as props at mount), Route Handler + SWR (last resort, narrow scope). Reaching for the bottom branch when an upper branch fits is the most common failure mode of this skill.

**Server Actions are for mutations only.** The only legitimate "action call from a button" that returns data is a follow-up to a user-initiated mutation (e.g., a form submission that returns the new record).

## Migrating away from `useEffect` + Server Action — the ladder

If you're staring at `useState` + `useEffect` + a `"use server"` read in a Client Component, walk this ladder **top-down** and stop at the first rung that fits. It's almost always rung 1. The most common failure mode of this skill is skipping rungs 1–3 and landing on rung 4 because it's the smallest physical diff.

1. **Lift the read to a Server Component.** Convert the page to `async function Page({ searchParams })`, `await` the read at the top, pass data down. If the page has interactive state, ask rung 2 _before_ deciding it has to stay client.
2. **Move state to URL `searchParams`.** Tabs, filters, ranges, pagination, sort, search query — all belong in the URL. The Client leaf calls `router.replace`; the Server Component re-renders with new data. The page stays a Server Component. Free streaming, free cache, shareable URL, back-button works.
3. **Pass `Promise<T>` from Server Component, consume with `use()` + `<Suspense>`.** Only when a Client Component genuinely needs server data as props at mount (charting libraries, third-party widgets that expect a synchronous data shape). Page stays a Server Component; only the interactive leaf is `"use client"`.
4. **`GET` Route Handler + SWR / React Query.** Reserved for: interval polling, focus revalidation, or a third party mutates the data outside your app. **Not** for "I already have a Client Component and want to keep it."

### The lateral migration is the failure mode

`useEffect` + action → `useSWR` + Route Handler in the same Client Component is the wrong refactor. It feels like progress — no more action-as-read — but:

- The page is still `"use client"`. No SSR, no streaming, same bad LCP.
- You traded a sequential POST queue for a sequential `fetch`. Same waterfall.
- "Route Handlers cache!" — not for per-user, per-org reads. Your `/api/cases` is `Cache-Control: private`; the CDN won't touch it; SWR dedups within one tab, not across users.
- You added a network hop, a JSON serialization layer, a client library, and an extra route file — for zero cache wins over the Server Component you should have written.

If you reached rung 4 without first asking "can this page simply be a Server Component?", you took the wrong rung. Back up.

## The four correct patterns

### 1. Async Server Component — the default

```tsx
// app/(platform)/cases/page.tsx
import { listCases } from "@/lib/services/case.service";

export default async function CasesPage() {
  const cases = await listCases();
  return <CasesTable cases={cases} />;
}
```

Use this whenever the data is needed for the initial render. No `"use client"`, no `useEffect`, no Server Action.

### 2. Stream a promise to a Client Component with `use()` + `<Suspense>`

When a Client Component (because of interactivity) needs server-fetched data on first render:

```tsx
// app/(platform)/cases/page.tsx — Server Component
import { Suspense } from "react";
import { listCases } from "@/lib/services/case.service";
import CasesTable from "./cases-table"; // Client Component

export default function CasesPage() {
  const casesPromise = listCases(); // do NOT await

  return (
    <Suspense fallback={<CasesTableSkeleton />}>
      <CasesTable casesPromise={casesPromise} />
    </Suspense>
  );
}
```

```tsx
// cases-table.tsx
"use client";
import { use } from "react";
import type { Case } from "@hive/types";

export default function CasesTable({ casesPromise }: { casesPromise: Promise<Case[]> }) {
  const cases = use(casesPromise); // suspends until resolved
  // …interactive UI
}
```

The Server Component starts the fetch, streams HTML as soon as it can, and the Client Component hydrates with the resolved value. No client-side waterfall.

### 3. Server Action — only for mutations, invoked via `<form>` or event handler after user intent

```tsx
"use server";
export async function archiveCase(id: string) {
  await db.update(cases).set({ archivedAt: new Date() }).where(eq(cases.id, id));
  revalidatePath("/cases");
}
```

After the mutation, call `revalidatePath` / `revalidateTag` and let the Server Component re-render with fresh data. Don't return a list to refresh client state by hand.

### 4. Route Handler + SWR / React Query — last resort, narrow scope

**Reach for this only when the data genuinely changes without user intent**: interval polling, focus revalidation, or a third party mutates the data outside your app. Anything else — initial data, post-mutation refresh, filter / tab / range state — belongs in patterns 1–3.

This is the _last resort_, not a peer of patterns 1–3. For per-user, per-org reads (almost everything in this project), "Route Handlers participate in HTTP caching" doesn't cash out: your route is `Cache-Control: private`, the CDN doesn't cache it, and SWR's dedup/focus-revalidation only helps within a single browser tab. You're paying for a network hop, a JSON layer, and a client library to land where a Server Component already started.

```ts
// app/api/dashboard/stats/route.ts — only because the dashboard polls every 5s
import { NextResponse } from "next/server";
import { getDashboardStats } from "@/lib/services/dashboard.service";

export async function GET(req: Request) {
  const range = new URL(req.url).searchParams.get("range") ?? "30d";
  return NextResponse.json(await getDashboardStats(range));
}
```

```tsx
"use client";
import useSWR from "swr";
const fetcher = (u: string) => fetch(u).then((r) => r.json());

export function LiveStats({ range }: { range: string }) {
  const { data } = useSWR(`/api/dashboard/stats?range=${range}`, fetcher, {
    refreshInterval: 5_000,
  });
  return; /* … */
}
```

If your Client Component doesn't poll, doesn't refetch on focus, and isn't watching externally-mutated data, **you don't need this**. Walk back up the migration ladder.

## Anti-pattern catalog — red ❌ → green ✅

Each pair is verified against the Next.js 16 App Router docs. Sources cited inline.

### 1. Reading data via a Server Action in `useEffect`

❌ **Red — sequential POST queue, no SSR, no streaming, no cache, double-fetch in dev Strict Mode:**

```tsx
"use client";
import { useEffect, useState } from "react";
import { getCases } from "@/lib/actions/cases.actions"; // "use server"

export default function CasesPage() {
  const [cases, setCases] = useState<Case[]>([]);
  useEffect(() => {
    getCases().then(setCases);
  }, []);
  return <CasesTable cases={cases} />;
}
```

✅ **Green — async Server Component, fetch on the server, stream HTML:**

```tsx
// app/(platform)/cases/page.tsx
import { listCases } from "@/lib/services/case.service";

export default async function CasesPage() {
  const cases = await listCases();
  return <CasesTable cases={cases} />;
}
```

> _"Server Functions are designed for server-side **mutations**, and the client currently dispatches and awaits them **one at a time**. […] If you need parallel data fetching, use data fetching in Server Components."_ — `docs/01-app/01-getting-started/07-mutating-data.mdx`

**No `useEffect` — ever.** Even the rare "fire a mutation on mount" case (e.g., a view counter that calls a Server Action when the page loads) does **not** use `useEffect` here. Per the `no-use-effect` skill, that's `useMountEffect` — the project's escape-hatch helper that wraps `useEffect(fn, [])` with explicit intent and a single eslint-disable in one place:

```tsx
"use client";
import { useMountEffect } from "@/lib/hooks/use-mount-effect";
import { incrementViews } from "@/lib/actions/views.actions"; // "use server" — a real mutation

export function ViewCounter() {
  useMountEffect(() => {
    incrementViews();
  });
  return null;
}
```

Even with `useMountEffect`, ask first: does this need to run on the client at all? A view increment can usually run inside the page Server Component (no client component, no hook). Reach for `useMountEffect` only when you genuinely need a browser-side trigger (DOM API, third-party widget, focus management).

---

### 2. Filter / tab / range state in `useState`, refetched via Server Action

❌ **Red — page becomes a Client Component to host the filter state; every chip click hits a queued POST:**

```tsx
"use client";
import { useEffect, useState } from "react";
import { getCases } from "@/lib/actions/cases.actions";

export default function CasesPage() {
  const [status, setStatus] = useState<"open" | "closed">("open");
  const [cases, setCases] = useState<Case[]>([]);
  useEffect(() => {
    getCases({ status }).then(setCases);
  }, [status]);
  return; /* filters + table */
}
```

✅ **Green — filter state lives in the URL `searchParams`; the Server Component re-renders with fresh data; the URL is shareable and the back button works:**

```tsx
// app/(platform)/cases/page.tsx — Server Component
import { listCases } from "@/lib/services/case.service";
import { CasesFilters } from "./cases-filters";

export default async function CasesPage({ searchParams }: { searchParams: Promise<{ status?: string }> }) {
  const { status = "open" } = await searchParams;
  const cases = await listCases({ status });
  return (
    <>
      <CasesFilters value={status} />
      <CasesTable cases={cases} />
    </>
  );
}
```

```tsx
// cases-filters.tsx — small Client Component, pushes to URL
"use client";
import { usePathname, useRouter, useSearchParams } from "next/navigation";

export function CasesFilters({ value }: { value: string }) {
  const router = useRouter();
  const pathname = usePathname();
  const sp = useSearchParams();
  const set = (status: string) => {
    const next = new URLSearchParams(sp);
    next.set("status", status);
    router.replace(`${pathname}?${next}`, { scroll: false });
  };
  return; /* chips that call set(...) */
}
```

> Server Components receive `searchParams` as an async prop; changing the URL re-runs the Server Component on the server. — `docs/01-app/01-getting-started/06-fetching-data.mdx` (page params/searchParams).

---

### 3. Manually re-running a read after a mutation

❌ **Red — reach for `setState` after every mutation, ship list-management code to the client:**

```tsx
"use client";
import { listCases, deleteCase } from "@/lib/actions/cases.actions";

export function CasesList() {
  const [cases, setCases] = useState<Case[]>([]);
  useEffect(() => {
    listCases().then(setCases);
  }, []);

  async function handleDelete(id: string) {
    await deleteCase(id);
    const fresh = await listCases(); // 2nd POST, sequential, no cache
    setCases(fresh);
  }
  /* … */
}
```

✅ **Green — mutate, call `revalidatePath` / `revalidateTag` / `refresh` inside the action; the Server Component re-renders with fresh data:**

```ts
// lib/actions/cases.actions.ts
"use server";
import { revalidatePath } from "next/cache";
import { requireOrgPermission } from "@/lib/auth";
import { deleteCase as deleteCaseService } from "@/lib/services/case.service";

export async function deleteCaseAction(id: string) {
  await requireOrgPermission("org:cases:delete");
  await deleteCaseService(id);
  revalidatePath("/cases");
}
```

```tsx
// delete-case-button.tsx — minimal Client Component
"use client";
import { useTransition } from "react";
import { deleteCaseAction } from "@/lib/actions/cases.actions";

export function DeleteCaseButton({ id }: { id: string }) {
  const [pending, start] = useTransition();
  return (
    <button disabled={pending} onClick={() => start(() => deleteCaseAction(id))}>
      {pending ? "Deleting…" : "Delete"}
    </button>
  );
}
```

> _"This ensures the UI displays the latest data after the mutation completes."_ — `docs/01-app/01-getting-started/07-mutating-data.mdx` on `revalidatePath`.

**Three variants — pick the narrowest one that does the job:**

- `revalidatePath('/cases')` — invalidate by route segment.
- `revalidateTag('cases')` — invalidate by tag (use when a service uses `fetch(..., { next: { tags: ['cases'] } })` or React's `cache()` with tags).
- `refresh()` from `next/cache` — inside a Server Action, refresh the client router cache for the current route. Useful when the mutation happens on the same page and you don't want to enumerate paths/tags.

---

### 4. `"use server"` file containing read-only `getX` / `listX` / `findX`

❌ **Red — Server Action whose only job is to `SELECT`. Inviting future code to call it from `useEffect`:**

```ts
// lib/actions/cases.actions.ts
"use server";
import { db } from "@/lib/db";
import { cases } from "@/lib/db/schema";

export async function getCases() {
  return db.select().from(cases);
}
```

✅ **Green — read logic lives in `lib/services/`, called directly from Server Components. Actions wrap services _for mutations only_:**

```ts
// lib/services/case.service.ts
import { db } from "@/lib/db";
import { cases } from "@/lib/db/schema";
import { requireOrgPermission } from "@/lib/auth";

export async function listCases(filters: CaseFilters = {}) {
  await requireOrgPermission("org:cases:read");
  return db.select().from(cases).where(/* … */);
}
```

```tsx
// app/(platform)/cases/page.tsx
import { listCases } from "@/lib/services/case.service";
export default async function Page() {
  const cases = await listCases();
  return <CasesTable cases={cases} />;
}
```

The service stays the single source of truth. Mutation actions in `lib/actions/` import the service for the write side. No duplication, clear responsibilities.

---

### 5. Promise-awaited then handed to a Client Component, blocking streaming

❌ **Red — `await` in the parent forces the whole subtree to wait before any HTML streams:**

```tsx
import { listCases } from "@/lib/services/case.service";
import CasesTable from "./cases-table"; // "use client"

export default async function Page() {
  const cases = await listCases(); // entire page waits
  return <CasesTable cases={cases} />;
}
```

✅ **Green — pass the unawaited `Promise<T>`; consume with `use()` + `<Suspense>` so the shell streams immediately:**

```tsx
// app/(platform)/cases/page.tsx — Server Component
import { Suspense } from "react";
import { listCases } from "@/lib/services/case.service";
import CasesTable from "./cases-table";

export default function Page() {
  const casesPromise = listCases(); // do NOT await
  return (
    <Suspense fallback={<CasesTableSkeleton />}>
      <CasesTable casesPromise={casesPromise} />
    </Suspense>
  );
}
```

```tsx
// cases-table.tsx
"use client";
import { use } from "react";

export default function CasesTable({ casesPromise }: { casesPromise: Promise<Case[]> }) {
  const cases = use(casesPromise);
  return; /* interactive UI */
}
```

> _"You can use React's `use` API to stream data from the server to client. […] The Client Component should be wrapped in a `<Suspense>` boundary, which displays a fallback while the promise is being resolved."_ — `docs/01-app/01-getting-started/06-fetching-data.mdx`

---

### 6. Optimistic UI built with manual `useState` + Server Action read-back

❌ **Red — bookkeeping the "real" state by hand, easy to desync:**

```tsx
"use client";
import { useState } from "react";
import { sendMessage, listMessages } from "@/lib/actions/chat.actions";

export function Thread({ initial }: { initial: Message[] }) {
  const [msgs, setMsgs] = useState(initial);
  async function onSend(text: string) {
    setMsgs((m) => [...m, { text, pending: true }]);
    await sendMessage(text);
    setMsgs(await listMessages()); // re-read via Server Action — anti-pattern #1
  }
  /* … */
}
```

✅ **Green — `useOptimistic`; the action does the mutation + `revalidatePath`, the optimistic value bridges the gap:**

```tsx
"use client";
import { useOptimistic } from "react";
import { sendMessage } from "@/lib/actions/chat.actions";

export function Thread({ messages }: { messages: Message[] }) {
  const [optimistic, addOptimistic] = useOptimistic<Message[], string>(messages, (state, text) => [
    ...state,
    { text, pending: true },
  ]);

  async function formAction(formData: FormData) {
    const text = formData.get("text") as string;
    addOptimistic(text);
    await sendMessage(text); // server-side mutation + revalidatePath
  }

  return (
    <>
      {optimistic.map((m, i) => (
        <div key={i}>{m.text}</div>
      ))}
      <form action={formAction}>{/* … */}</form>
    </>
  );
}
```

> _"`useOptimistic` enables immediate UI updates before a server action completes."_ — `docs/01-app/02-guides/forms.mdx`. Source of truth stays on the server; the optimistic state is purely local UI bridge.

---

### 7. Polling / interval-refetch via Server Action

This is the **only** anti-pattern in this section whose `✅` solution is pattern 4 (Route Handler + SWR), and only because the Red genuinely polls. If your `useEffect` + action just runs once at mount to load data, the Green for _that_ case is pattern 1 (Server Component) or pattern 2 (`Promise<T>` + `use()`) — **not** this one. Don't grab this code as the template for migrating any `useEffect` + action to SWR.

❌ **Red — Server Actions are queued and uncached, polling them serializes the whole page:**

```tsx
"use client";
useEffect(() => {
  const id = setInterval(async () => {
    setStats(await getDashboardStats()); // queue grows on every tick
  }, 5_000);
  return () => clearInterval(id);
}, []);
```

✅ **Green — only because this genuinely polls every 5s. `GET` Route Handler + SWR / React Query:**

```ts
// app/api/dashboard/stats/route.ts
import { NextResponse } from "next/server";
import { getDashboardStats } from "@/lib/services/dashboard.service";

export async function GET(req: Request) {
  const range = new URL(req.url).searchParams.get("range") ?? "30d";
  const stats = await getDashboardStats(range);
  return NextResponse.json(stats);
}
```

```tsx
"use client";
import useSWR from "swr";
const fetcher = (u: string) => fetch(u).then((r) => r.json());

export function LiveStats({ range }: { range: string }) {
  const { data } = useSWR(`/api/dashboard/stats?range=${range}`, fetcher, {
    refreshInterval: 5_000,
  });
  return; /* … */
}
```

The honest claim: Server Actions are queued, single-flight, can't be cancelled, and have no dedup. For _genuine_ polling they're worse than Route Handlers — that's the whole reason this pattern exists. The "Route Handlers cache!" framing oversells: per-user reads are `Cache-Control: private`, CDN-uncacheable, and SWR's dedup applies only within one tab.

---

### 8. Page made `"use client"` "because I need state for the UI"

❌ **Red — moving the whole page to the client to get a single piece of interactive state:**

```tsx
"use client"; // entire page is now a Client Component
import { useState } from "react";

export default function CasesPage() {
  const [tab, setTab] = useState("open");
  /* fetches via useEffect, etc. */
}
```

✅ **Green — keep the page as a Server Component; isolate the interactive bit in a small Client Component child:**

```tsx
// app/(platform)/cases/page.tsx — Server Component
import { listCases } from "@/lib/services/case.service";
import { TabBar } from "./tab-bar"; // "use client", pushes ?tab=… to URL

export default async function CasesPage({ searchParams }: { searchParams: Promise<{ tab?: string }> }) {
  const { tab = "open" } = await searchParams;
  const cases = await listCases({ tab });
  return (
    <>
      <TabBar value={tab} />
      <CasesTable cases={cases} />
    </>
  );
}
```

The default for every new page should be Server Component. Add `"use client"` to the smallest leaf that needs interactivity, never to the page itself.

## Red flags — STOP and switch pattern

If you catch yourself writing or approving any of these, stop:

- `useEffect(() => { someServerAction().then(setX) }, [])`
- `useState<T[]>([])` + `useEffect` that calls a `"use server"` function
- `"use server"` file containing functions named `get*`, `list*`, `find*`, `fetch*`, `load*`, `read*`
- A page, layout, or template converted to `"use client"` because "I need state for the filters"
- Manually re-running a `listX`/`getX` action after a mutation instead of `revalidatePath` / `revalidateTag`
- Two or more Server Action calls inside the same effect or event handler (guaranteed sequential)
- Filter/range/tab state in `useState` + a Server Action refetch on change (use URL `searchParams` instead — they trigger a Server Component re-render, no client refetch needed)
- Adding a Suspense `key={range}` and a Server Component that re-runs is **good**; adding a Suspense `key` so a `useEffect` fires again is the wrong pattern with a new wrapper
- **Migrating `useEffect` + Server Action to `useSWR` + `GET /api/…` Route Handler in the same Client Component, without first asking whether the page could simply be a Server Component.** This is _the_ most common failure mode of this skill — it feels like progress, but the page stays `"use client"`, the waterfall stays, the LCP stays bad, and you've added a network hop and a client library for nothing. Walk the migration ladder.
- Introducing a `GET /api/x` Route Handler to feed `useSWR` in a page that has no genuine reason to be `"use client"` — no polling, no focus refetch, no third-party data source. The page wants to be a Server Component; let it.
- `useSWR` whose only `refreshInterval` / `revalidateOnFocus` config is the default (off) — i.e., it's only ever loading once. That's not what SWR is for; pass `Promise<T>` from a Server Component and `use()` it instead.

## Audit

When the user asks to **audit** a codebase against this skill (phrasings: "audit my codebase against nextjs-data-fetching", "/audit-data-fetching", "scan for data-fetching anti-patterns", "find violations of the data-fetching rules"), follow this recipe. Do not modify code during the audit — produce a report only. Offer to fix issues afterwards.

### Step 1 — confirm scope

Run scope checks first; if they fail, abort the audit and tell the user why:

- `package.json` has `"next": "^16…"` (or 16.x range).
- Routes live under `app/`, not `pages/`.

If the project is mixed (some apps on App Router, some on Pages), narrow the audit to the App Router app(s) and say so in the report.

### Step 2 — scan for the eight anti-patterns

Run these greps in parallel from the project root. Each maps to one of the numbered anti-patterns in this skill. Use ripgrep where available; fall back to `grep -rn`.

```bash
# 1. useEffect calling a Server Action / async fetch in a Client Component
rg -n --type=tsx --type=ts -B1 -A8 'useEffect\s*\(' \
  -g '!node_modules' -g '!.next' \
  | rg -B2 -A1 -e 'await\s+\w+\(' -e '\.then\(' -e 'fetch\('

# 2. Filter/tab state in useState that triggers a re-fetch
rg -n --type=tsx --type=ts -e 'useState.*(?:filter|tab|range|sort|page)' \
  -g '!node_modules' -g '!.next'

# 3. Manual setState refresh after a mutation (look near server-action call sites)
rg -n --type=tsx --type=ts -B2 -A6 -e 'await\s+\w+Action\(' -e "from\s+['\"]@/lib/actions" \
  -g '!node_modules' -g '!.next' \
  | rg -B4 -A2 -e 'setState\(' -e 'set[A-Z]\w+\('

# 4. Read-only functions exported from "use server" files
rg -n --type=ts -B3 -A1 -e '^\s*export\s+(async\s+)?function\s+(get|list|find|fetch|load|search)[A-Z]' \
  $(rg -l --type=ts '"use server"' -g '!node_modules' -g '!.next' 2>/dev/null) 2>/dev/null

# 5. Awaited promises passed as props to Client children (blocks streaming)
#    Heuristic: server component awaits, then renders a "use client" component with the awaited value.
rg -n --type=tsx -B1 -A6 -e '^\s*const\s+\w+\s*=\s*await\s+' \
  -g '!node_modules' -g '!.next'

# 6. useState + Server Action read-back instead of useOptimistic
rg -n --type=tsx -B2 -A8 -e 'useState' \
  -g '!node_modules' -g '!.next' \
  | rg -B4 -A4 -e 'Action\(' \
  | rg -v 'useOptimistic'

# 7. Polling via setInterval/setTimeout calling a Server Action or async read
rg -n --type=tsx --type=ts -B1 -A6 -e 'setInterval\(' -e 'setTimeout\(.*,\s*\d{4,}' \
  -g '!node_modules' -g '!.next'

# 8. Pages or layouts marked "use client" at the top level
rg -ln --type=tsx '^"use client"' app/ \
  | rg -e '/page\.tsx$' -e '/layout\.tsx$' -e '/template\.tsx$'
```

For findings under `lib/actions/`, additionally inspect each file: any function whose body is a single `select` / `findMany` / `findUnique` / `service.list*` / `service.get*` call is a **Pattern 4** violation regardless of name.

### Step 3 — produce the report

Produce a markdown report grouped by anti-pattern (1 through 8). For each finding, include:

- File path and line number (clickable: `path/to/file.tsx:42`).
- A 3–5 line excerpt showing the offending code.
- Which anti-pattern it matches.
- The corresponding fix from the catalog (link to the section heading), in one sentence.
- Severity: **high** (Pattern 1, 4, 7, 8 — direct rule violations), **medium** (Pattern 2, 3, 5, 6 — usually rule violations but sometimes legitimate), **low** (heuristic match that needs human eyes).

Sort within each group by severity, then file path.

End the report with a summary table:

| Pattern | High | Medium | Low | Total |
| ------- | ---- | ------ | --- | ----- |

…and a one-paragraph recommendation: which anti-pattern dominates, and which one to tackle first (usually Pattern 1 or 4 — they're the highest-leverage and the easiest to refactor mechanically).

### Step 4 — offer next steps

After delivering the report, offer (do not execute unprompted):

1. **Fix one pattern at a time** — pick the highest-volume pattern, refactor it across the codebase, run tests/typecheck.
2. **Fix one file at a time** — work top-down through the report.
3. **Open a tracking issue** — convert the report to a GitHub issue with a checklist.

Wait for the user to choose before touching code.

## In this project

- Reads live in `lib/services/*.service.ts` and are called from async Server Components (the existing pattern in `app/(platform)/`, `app/(hr)/`, etc.).
- `lib/actions/*.actions.ts` files are **mutation-only** — they exist to wrap services with `requirePermission`, validation, audit logging, and `revalidatePath`. If you find yourself adding a `getX` / `listX` action, stop: call the service directly from a Server Component instead.
- After a mutation, always end the action with `revalidatePath` (or `revalidateTag`) so the next Server Component render sees fresh data. Do not return data to update client state by hand.
