# Test Type Decision Guide

Read this file when deciding which types of tests to write for a feature or
project. Tests are organized into three tiers by priority.

A test tier is a resource contract: what the test may touch (network,
database, filesystem, threads, sleeps, wall-clock budget). Treat a violation
as misclassification and enforce mechanically where the runner allows. When
tier ratios stop settling arguments, argue the five axes explicitly — Speed,
Maintainability, Utilization (resource cost), Reliability (flakiness),
Fidelity — improving one is only free when it does not cost the others.

## Step Zero: can the type replace the test?

Before reaching the tier system, ask: _could this test exist only because the
function's parameter type is too loose?_

| Test you were about to write                  | Type-level alternative                                    |
| --------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `test_X_rejects_null`                         | Make the parameter `T`, not `Optional[T]`                 |
| `test_X_rejects_empty`                        | Make the parameter `NonEmpty[T]`                          |
| `test_X_rejects_negative`                     | Use `u32` / smart constructor / `NonNegative` newtype     |
| `test_X_rejects_invalid_email`                | Make the parameter `EmailAddress`, parsed at the boundary |
| `test_invalid_state_transition`               | Use sealed enum / typestate / phantom types               |
| `test_builder_rejects_missing_required_field` | Make the field a required builder argument                |
| `assert_should_never_happen`                  | Tighten the type so the state is unrepresentable          |

If a tighter type would make the assertion structural rather than defensive,
fix the type and **don't** write the test. See
`references/correctness-by-construction.md`.

This applies _inside_ a trust boundary. **Across** a trust boundary (HTTP,
file, IPC, external API, user input) the wire format is untyped, so parser
tests, contract tests, and VCR cassettes still earn their keep — they are
correctness-by-construction re-erected at the boundary.

Ward Cunningham's CHECKS adds one calibration: validation intensity should match the action's consequence. Saving a draft, publishing, charging a card, and deleting data do not need the same checks. Test the boundary parser and the action-specific validation choke point; do not smear identical validation tests through every downstream method.

### After Step Zero: the two invariant tests

Once the invariant lives in the type, write _both_ tests below. Most
projects write only the first; the second is the highest-yield audit
practice the testing literature underweights.

**Tactic A — invariant-proof.** A property-based test asserting that, for
any input satisfying the precondition, the postcondition holds. This is
the runtime shadow of a Hoare triple `{P} S {Q}`.

```python
@given(orders())
def test_cancel_invariant(order):
    cancelled = order.cancel()
    assert cancelled.status is OrderStatus.CANCELLED
    assert cancelled.items == order.items
```

**Tactic B — model-gap.** A test that tries to construct each invalid state
the type claims to forbid, and asserts the construction fails. _If the
construction succeeds, the model is too loose — fix the model, not the
test._

```python
def test_paid_empty_is_unrepresentable():
    with pytest.raises((ValueError, TypeError)):
        Order(status=OrderStatus.PAID, items=[])
```

A and B together replace per-layer "rejects invalid input" tests entirely.
A says "the function obeys its contract." B says "the contract actually
excludes what we claim it excludes."

## The trust-boundary lens

```
   UNTYPED INPUT             TYPED INTERIOR                   UNTYPED OUTPUT
   (HTTP, file, user)        (rich domain types)              (DB, external API)
   ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
        │                          │                                 │
        ▼                          ▼                                 ▼
   Parser tests at         Behavior tests on the              Contract tests,
   boundary (PBT,          public interface (test what        VCR cassettes,
   valid-or-absent)        it DOES, not what it rejects)      E2E across boundary
```

- **At the inbound boundary**: parse, don't validate. One parser test per
  type, ideally property-based.
- **In the typed interior**: behavior tests on the public interface. Do not
  re-test invariants the types already enforce.
- **At the outbound boundary**: contract tests, VCR cassettes, E2E.

## Examples as communication

When users, domain experts, bug reporters, support teams, or PMs provide concrete examples, keep their language visible. Tests are executable examples before they are coverage artifacts.

- Convert business-rule rows into table-driven tests or fixture files at the domain/service seam.
- Do not drive every rule row through the UI. Use one or a few UI/E2E tests to prove wiring, then test the rule table below the UI.
- Prefer customer-sourced examples over expecting customers to maintain executable tests.
- If examples require a custom helper or mini-DSL, keep it small and test the helper itself.
- Add prose or test names that explain why the example matters, not only the expected value.

## Calibrate by lifetime and change kind

| Situation                                        | Test posture                                                                                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Throwaway spike or research probe                | No test or one smoke/characterization check if the result will be reused. State the lifecycle instead of adding test theater. |
| Reusable library, parser, SDK, or data structure | Regression, property/exhaustive, contract, and mutation/differential checks where triggered.                                  |
| Behavior change                                  | Add or update a test that can fail for the behavior. Prefer red-green evidence when feasible.                                 |
| Pure structure/tidying                           | Use the existing green suite. If no suite protects the behavior, add characterization tests first.                            |
| Technical debt repayment/refactor                | Characterize current behavior, then refactor under a green suite; debt without tests is harder to repay safely.               |

## TDD micro-tactics

Use these when the user asks for TDD or when a bug fix/new behavior can be developed test-first:

- **Test List**: write the next known tests down. When a new idea appears mid-cycle, add it to the list instead of breaking the red/green focus.
- **Assert First**: write the final assertion, then work backward to setup.
- **Evident Data**: make expected values readable as expressions or named examples, not unexplained constants.
- **Child Test**: if a test is too large to make pass, extract a smaller failing test and return to the larger one later.
- **Learning Test**: pin third-party API behavior before depending on it.
- **Crash Test Dummy**: use a fake that raises/returns failure to exercise hard error paths.
- **Fake It / Triangulate / Obvious Implementation**: pick the green strategy based on uncertainty; replace fake constants once the second example forces generalization.

Team rule: do not commit failing unit tests. For solo work, a broken test can be a re-entry marker only if it is not pushed as green proof.

## Tier 1: Always Required

### Unit Tests

- **When**: Every function with non-trivial logic (`if`, loops, arithmetic)
- **Rules**: meaningful behavior oracle, relevant happy/sad/boundary paths, no live network or persistent shared filesystem. Temp dirs, in-memory stores, and local fakes are fine.
- **Assertion calibration**: example-based behavior tests often need multiple assertions; table rows, property tests, and exception tests may have one strong oracle.
- **Cost**: Low setup, fast, stable

### Smoke Tests

- **When**: Every deployable unit (app, service, CLI)
- **What**: "The app starts and responds to the main endpoint"
- **Cost**: Very low — one test that boots the app

### Regression Tests

- **When**: After every bug fix
- **How**: Write the failing test BEFORE fixing the bug
- **Rules**: Name after the bug/issue number, include a comment explaining it

## Tier 2: Required When Triggered

### Property-Based Tests

**Trigger**: ANY of these apply:

- [ ] Function accepts strings/numbers/binary from users
- [ ] Function serializes/deserializes data
- [ ] Function transforms data (output preserves some input property)
- [ ] Function is a parser (should never crash on arbitrary input)
- [ ] Function computes rankings/scores/orderings

**Cost**: Medium. Requires thinking in invariants, slower to run.

### Fuzz Targets

**Trigger**: A hostile-input boundary has an amplifying risk such as public exposure, custom length/offset/chunk parsing, native or unsafe decoding, prior crashes, or a security scanner/filter that can be bypassed by crashing it—and the project has or is willing to support an appropriate coverage-guided engine.

A small target is distinct from a long campaign. Keep it fast, bounded, connected to production code, and compatible with the selected engine's failure/replay mechanism. For lower-risk or trusted inputs, examples, exhaustive cases, or ordinary properties may be enough. See `references/fuzzing.md`.

### E2E / Acceptance Tests

**Trigger**: ANY of these apply:

- [ ] Project has HTTP endpoints or a CLI with multi-step workflows
- [ ] Project runs on a specific platform (Workers, Pyodide, etc.)
- [ ] Previous bugs were missed by unit tests
- [ ] Domain experts supplied concrete examples that define a story or rule
- [ ] A new feature changes the meaning of an existing action (redirects it, overrides it, alters its default) — test the composed workflow, not each feature alone; two individually well-tested features can still destroy data at their seam

**Rules**: Golden path first, gate behind env vars, limit to 5-15 tests. For business-rule examples, prefer acceptance tests at the domain/API seam and only enough UI/E2E coverage to prove wiring. For a new service or first feature, build a **walking skeleton**: the thinnest build/deploy/test slice that exercises real packaging, configuration, and one path through the system. Track not-yet-implemented acceptance tests as in-progress with an issue/story link; do not hide them as unconditional skips. Record known fidelity gaps when a fake replaces a real service, and schedule a real-service check when that risk matters.
**Cost**: High setup, slow, can be flaky.

### Documentation-Code Sync Tests

**Trigger**: ANY of these apply:

- [ ] Project has CLI commands listed in docs
- [ ] Project has a plugin/hook system with documented extension points
- [ ] Project has configuration settings described in docs

**How**: Parametrize over code registries, verify each item is in docs.

### Contract Tests

**Trigger**: ANY of these apply:

- [ ] Unit tests use mocks for external services
- [ ] Unit tests use stubs for browser APIs
- [ ] There are precomputed data files that code depends on

**How**: Validate mock return values against reality in a real environment.

### VCR Cassette Tests (External API Testing)

**Trigger**: ANY of these apply:

- [ ] Code calls third-party APIs (LLM providers, payment, auth)
- [ ] Tests use hand-written mock HTTP responses
- [ ] External API tests are flaky due to network issues

**How**: Record real API responses to files and replay in tests. See
`references/vcr-cassettes.md`.
**Cost**: Low maintenance, occasional re-recording needed.

### Characterization Tests

**Trigger**: ANY of these apply:

- [ ] About to refactor legacy or unfamiliar code
- [ ] No existing test suite for the code being changed
- [ ] Behavior is undocumented and unclear

**How**: Call the code and record actual outputs as assertions. See
`references/characterization-testing.md`.
**Cost**: Low setup, medium maintenance (must decide which behaviors to keep).

### Differential Tests

**Trigger**: ANY of these apply:

- [ ] Reimplementing a known algorithm (tokenizer, encoder, hash)
- [ ] A trusted reference implementation exists (PyTorch, tiktoken, stdlib)
- [ ] Building an optimized version of known-correct code

**How**: Run same inputs through both implementations and assert outputs match.
See `references/differential-testing.md`.
**Cost**: Low if reference exists, high if you must build one.

### Golden File / Fixture-Based Tests

**Trigger**: ANY of these apply:

- [ ] Code transforms input files to output files (HTML→Markdown, compilation)
- [ ] Code generates complex output that's hard to assert on field-by-field
- [ ] You have real-world input files to test against

**How**: Store inputs in `tests/fixtures/`, expected outputs in `tests/expected/`.
Auto-discover fixtures, auto-baseline on first run. See
`references/golden-file-testing.md`.
**Cost**: Low setup. Human-reviewable baselines. Catches drift.

### Pirate Tests (Language-Neutral Conformance)

**Trigger**: ANY of these apply:

- [ ] A specification has multiple implementations across languages
- [ ] You maintain SDKs/libraries in several languages that must behave the same
- [ ] An open standard needs a conformance test suite

**How**: Write test cases as data (JSON/YAML). Each implementation provides a
harness that loads the data and runs assertions. No implementation is privileged.
See `references/differential-testing.md`.
**Cost**: Medium (harness per language), but amortized across all implementations.

## Tier 3: Use With Caution

### Visual Regression / Screenshot Tests

- **When helpful**: UI-heavy projects where pixel layout matters
- **Costs**: Cross-platform font differences cause false positives
- **Mitigations**: Skip in CI, disable animations, capture components not pages,
  mask timestamps and dynamic content

### Mutation Testing

- **When helpful**: After quality audit reveals low assertion density; for
  security-critical code; when coverage is 80%+ but bug escapes persist
- **Costs**: 10-100x test runtime. Requires interpretation.
- **Mitigations**: Run on specific critical modules, nightly not per-commit
- **Tools**: mutmut (Python), Stryker (JS/TS), PIT (Java), gremlins (Go),
  cargo-mutants (Rust). See `references/mutation-testing.md`.

### Performance / Benchmark Tests

- **When helpful**: A 2x slowdown would be a user-visible bug
- **Costs**: Results vary between machines
- **Mitigations**: Compare against baseline, separate from test suite

### Long Fuzz Campaigns

- **When helpful**: Exposed parsers, reusable parser/decoder/protocol libraries, security-sensitive boundaries, crash-prone code, or a corpus that benefits from continued coverage growth
- **Costs**: CPU, artifact storage, sanitizer builds, and triage—not inherent irreproducibility
- **Mitigations**: Replay seeds/regressions on every change; run bounded active discovery where practical; move minute/hour campaigns to scheduled CI or continuous fuzzing

Use the engine's minimized failure and replay mechanism rather than a universal seed rule. Ordinary seed replay is valuable regression coverage, but it is not a fuzz campaign. Fuzzing supplies inputs, not a weaker oracle for deterministic exact outputs.

## Minimum Viable Test Suite

For any project, start with: 0. **Step Zero pass**: invariants encoded in types where the language allows.
You write the type instead of the test.

1. One smoke test (app starts and responds)
2. Unit tests for business logic (3+ assertions, happy + sad path) — exercise
   _behavior_ on the precise types, not validation the types already enforce
3. Regression test for every bug fix (written before the fix)

Add Tier 2 and 3 tests as trigger conditions apply.

## After writing tests: the dual question

For each test you wrote, ask: _could a tighter type have replaced this?_ If
yes, do the type change and delete the test. The goal is a small,
behavior-focused test suite anchored by a strong type system, not a large
suite that re-enacts the type system at runtime.
