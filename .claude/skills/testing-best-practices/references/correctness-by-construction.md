# Correctness by Construction

Read this when the project uses a typed language (Rust, TypeScript, OCaml,
Haskell, Scala, modern Kotlin/Swift, Go with newtype wrappers, Python with
strict dataclasses/Pydantic) **or** when an Assess-mode audit reveals the
same invariant being checked at three or more layers, status enums duplicated
across layers, loose strings flowing through the whole system, catch-all
retries, silent fallbacks, or post-hoc sanitizer patches.

The principle: **lift invariants into the type or schema so the wrong state
is unrepresentable**. Then the only test that needs to exist is the parser
test at the boundary, plus tests that _prove the invariant_ and tests that
_reveal invalid states the model still permits_.

Ward Cunningham's CHECKS pattern language is the pragmatic version of this rule: use Whole Values for domain quantities, defer validation until a specific action needs it, echo back the system's interpretation, and make summarized values auditable back to their source. For tests, this means concentrating validation tests at boundary parsers and action-specific choke points instead of repeating identical rejection tests throughout the typed interior.

What unifies them: invariants belong in the _spec/type/contract_, not in
scattered runtime checks. Tests then either _prove_ the invariant holds or
_search for inputs/states that violate it_.

## When defense-in-depth is the antipattern (collapse it)

The phrase is right — applied to internal program logic — when it means any
of these:

- **Repeated validation everywhere.** Controller checks `user_id != null`,
  service checks again, repository checks again, SQL has `WHERE … IS NOT
NULL`. Each layer defends against the same failure mode.
- **Loose strings passed through the whole system.** `def send_email(addr:
str)` re-parsed at every call site instead of carrying an `EmailAddress`
  type from the boundary inward.
- **Status enums duplicated across layers.** `OrderStatus` re-declared in
  the API DTO, the service, the repo, and the UI — each variant has to be
  mapped four times, every transition needs four tests, and adding a state
  silently misses one of the layers.
- **Catch-all retries.** `for _ in range(3): try ... except Exception: ...`
  hides a real failure inside an opaque retry loop instead of distinguishing
  retryable from non-retryable failures in the type.
- **Silent fallback behavior.** `get_user(id) or default_user()` hides the
  fact that the lookup failed; the postcondition "the returned user matches
  the request" is silently violated.
- **Post-hoc sanitizer patches.** A regex added "after the fact" to strip a
  bad character that never should have been representable in the first
  place.
- **Runtime guards instead of state machines / types / schema constraints.**
  `if order.status == "paid" and order.items: ...` is a state-machine
  transition expressed as ad-hoc if-statements; the model permits
  `Paid + empty items`, so every consumer must check.

In all these cases, every layer defends against the _same_ failure mode. The
test surface explodes — every layer demands its own "rejects bad input" test
— and ownership of the invariant is unclear. The fix is to push the
invariant into a single structural form (type, smart constructor, sealed
enum, schema constraint). Only remove duplicate downstream checks and tests
after verifying the context is internal/non-adversarial, the invariant is
enforced structurally, boundary tests cover hostile input, and security or
external-failure layers are not defending distinct threats.

## When defense-in-depth is still necessary (keep all layers and all tests)

Defense-in-depth is the right model whenever the layers face _different_
failure modes or _different_ threat models. Concretely:

- **Hostile input.** Untrusted bytes from network/users; the boundary parser
  is one layer, schema validation is another, runtime sanitization at the
  output is another.
- **Auth / security boundaries.** Authentication, authorization, tenancy
  isolation, audit logging — each defends against a distinct attack class.
- **SSRF / XSS / injection / secrets.** Output escaping, parameterized
  queries, content-security policy, secret-rotation, allowlists — the
  controls compose because they cover orthogonal vectors.
- **External system failure.** Timeouts, retries, circuit breakers, and
  fallbacks each handle a _different_ downstream-failure regime.
- **Rate limits.** Application-level + edge + per-tenant limits each catch
  abuse the others miss.
- **Retries.** Idempotency keys + bounded retry + jittered backoff + dead-
  letter queue each guard a distinct failure path.
- **Observability.** Logs, metrics, traces, alerts — independent signals so
  one failure mode doesn't blind you to another.
- **Recovery and forensics.** Backups, replay logs, immutable audit trails —
  defenses against catastrophic loss and against tampering, respectively.

The rule, stated once:

> Defense-in-depth is virtue when each layer defends against a _different_
> failure mode or a _different_ adversary. It is an antipattern when each
> layer defends against the _same_ failure mode in a non-adversarial,
> already-typed context.

## The two tests that matter most

Once the invariant lives in the type/schema/contract, two test tactics
together do the heavy lifting. Most other tests can be deleted.

### A. Tests that _prove_ the invariant

These are the runtime shadow of a Hoare triple `{P} S {Q}`. Property-based
testing is the practical mechanism: for any input satisfying the
precondition, assert the postcondition holds.

```python
@given(st.text())
def test_email_parser_proves_its_invariant(s):
    addr = EmailAddress.parse(s)
    if addr is None:
        return                                  # pre-condition not met
    assert "@" in addr.value                    # post-condition
    assert len(addr.value) <= 254
    assert addr == EmailAddress.parse(addr.value)  # idempotent
```

```python
@given(orders())
def test_order_state_machine_invariant(order):
    # Class invariant: a Paid order has at least one item.
    if order.status is OrderStatus.PAID:
        assert len(order.items) >= 1
    # Postcondition of cancel(): status becomes CANCELLED, items unchanged.
    cancelled = order.cancel()
    assert cancelled.status is OrderStatus.CANCELLED
    assert cancelled.items == order.items
```

These tests survive refactoring because they assert _what must always be
true_, not _what the implementation does today_. They're what tests look
like after the type system has done its job.

### B. Tests that _reveal invalid states the model still permits_

This is the adversarial twin. Your type or schema _claims_ certain states
are impossible. Test that claim by trying to reach them. If you can, the
model is incomplete — fix the model, not the test.

This is the testing tactic the user community most often skips. It's the
single most useful audit you can run against a typed system.

**Caveat — weak runtime enforcement.** A tactic-B test that asserts
"this state is unconstructible" passes _trivially_ if no mechanism
actually rejects it. Two cases to watch for:

1. **Go zero values.** `var e Email` is always constructible; the
   unexported-field trick only prevents _outside_ callers from using
   composite literals and nudges them through `ParseEmail`. A tactic-B
   test on the zero value passes vacuously. Either add a `Valid() bool`
   method and exercise it with tactic-A tests, or document that the
   invariant is enforced by convention and is _not_ tactic-B-testable.
2. **Dynamic languages without a constructor check.** If `Order(status,
items)` is a plain dataclass with no `__post_init__`, you must add
   the runtime check first, then write the tactic-B test that exercises
   it. Writing the test against an unprotected constructor is worse than
   writing nothing — it documents a model that doesn't exist.

**Rule:** tactic B is only meaningful when a runtime or compile-time
mechanism _can_ reject the state. If there isn't one, add one before
writing the test, or skip tactic B for that invariant and rely on the
boundary parser plus contract tests.

```python
def test_order_model_forbids_paid_empty():
    """The Order type claims `Paid + items=[]` is impossible. Prove it."""
    with pytest.raises((ValueError, TypeError)):
        Order(status=OrderStatus.PAID, items=[])
    # If this test passes by raising, the invariant is in the constructor.
    # If it fails because Order(...) returns successfully, the type is
    # too loose — fix Order to reject this state.
```

```rust
#[test]
fn user_id_zero_is_unrepresentable() {
    // We claim UserId cannot wrap 0. Try to make one and assert it fails.
    assert!(UserId::new(0).is_none());
    // If this ever passes by returning Some, the invariant has regressed.
}
```

For larger state spaces, use exhaustive enumeration (small enums,
booleans, short tuples) or property-based testing with shrinking:

```python
# Enumerate every (status, items_count) pair the type permits.
# For each, classify "should be valid" vs "should be invalid".
# Failures reveal model gaps.
@given(st.from_type(OrderStatus), st.integers(min_value=0, max_value=3))
def test_no_invalid_state_is_constructible(status, n):
    items = [Item("x") for _ in range(n)]
    invalid = (status is OrderStatus.PAID and n == 0)
    if invalid:
        with pytest.raises((ValueError, TypeError)):
            Order(status=status, items=items)
    else:
        Order(status=status, items=items)            # must succeed
```

When this test fails by _not_ raising, you have found a hole in your model.
That is the entire point of the test.

A useful framing: type A tests are **"does the function obey its
contract?"**; type B tests are **"does the contract actually exclude what
we said it excludes?"** Both are necessary; neither is a "rejects null"
test repeated at every layer.

## Patterns by language

### TypeScript: branded types

```typescript
type EmailAddress = string & { readonly __brand: "EmailAddress" };

function parseEmail(raw: string): EmailAddress | null {
  if (!/^[^@\s]+@[^@\s]+\.[^@\s]+$/.test(raw)) return null;
  if (raw.length > 254) return null;
  return raw as EmailAddress;
}

function sendEmail(address: EmailAddress) {
  /* no check needed */
}
```

Tests:

- A: PBT on `parseEmail` proves `valid-or-absent` and idempotence.
- B: `expect(() => sendEmail("not-an-address" as EmailAddress)).toBe(...)`
  is _unnecessary_ — the unsafe cast is the only way to construct the bad
  state, so the gap is the cast itself. Document with a lint rule
  forbidding unbranded casts.

### Rust: newtype with private constructor

```rust
pub struct UserId(u64);

impl UserId {
    pub fn new(raw: u64) -> Option<Self> {
        if raw == 0 { None } else { Some(UserId(raw)) }
    }
    pub fn value(&self) -> u64 { self.0 }
}
```

Tests:

- A: PBT on `UserId::new` — `Some` outputs always have non-zero `value()`.
- B: An exhaustive boundary test — `UserId::new(0)` is `None`,
  `UserId::new(u64::MAX)` is `Some`. Document that any test asking
  "what if `lookup` is called with 0?" _cannot be written_ — the call
  doesn't compile.

### Python: smart constructor with `__post_init__`

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class NonEmptyList(Generic[T]):
    items: tuple[T, ...]

    def __post_init__(self):
        if not self.items:
            raise ValueError("NonEmptyList must have at least one item")

    @property
    def first(self) -> T:                # total — no Optional needed
        return self.items[0]
```

Tests:

- A: PBT — `NonEmptyList([x, *rest]).first == x`.
- B: `pytest.raises(ValueError) when NonEmptyList(())` and
  `NonEmptyList([])`. If either passes, the model is broken.

### Go: unexported field + constructor

```go
type Email struct{ s string }

func ParseEmail(raw string) (Email, error) { /* ... */ }
func (e Email) String() string { return e.s }
```

Tests:

- A: Table-driven test that for every valid input, `ParseEmail` returns an
  `Email` whose `String()` round-trips.
- B: Confirm the zero value `var e Email` is constructible. Outside the
  package, `Email{}` with unexported fields is blocked, but the zero value is
  still unavoidable. Then write a _contract test_ that any `Email` obtained by
  `ParseEmail` is non-empty. The gap is the zero value; documenting it is the
  test.

---

## Tests to delete after lifting invariants

After the invariant lives in the type/schema/contract, delete tests that:

1. Verify a downstream function "rejects" a value the type now forbids
2. Verify a "this should never happen" branch fires
3. Verify defaults that the type's constructor enforces
4. Verify the same `if x is None` guard that appears in five places
5. Verify a status-enum exhaustiveness check in every layer (the compiler
   does this once)

Coverage may drop. That is correct — you replaced runtime checks with
compile-time guarantees, and there is nothing left to cover.

## Tests to keep (and to add)

1. **One parser/constructor test per type at each trust boundary**, ideally
   property-based with `valid-or-absent` (`A`).
2. **Invariant-proof tests** on functions that operate on the type — Hoare
   triples expressed as PBT (`A`).
3. **Model-gap tests** that try to construct invalid states and assert they
   are rejected (`B`). When the test passes, the model holds. When it
   _fails by succeeding_, you found the gap.
4. **One contract test at every external boundary** — wire formats are
   untyped, so the guarantee must be re-erected at the boundary.

## Tests organized by trust boundary

| Boundary                       | Test                              | Why                        |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| HTTP body → DTO                | Parser test (PBT) + contract test | Wire format is untyped     |
| File / config → struct         | Parser test + golden file         | Disk is untyped            |
| External API response → object | VCR cassette + parser test        | Provider can change shape  |
| DB row → entity                | Repository test                   | Schema can drift from code |
| User input → form              | Parser test + property test       | Untrusted by definition    |
| IPC / queue message → event    | Pirate / contract test            | Cross-process boundary     |

Inside the boundary: `A` and `B` tests on the public interface. Nothing else.

| Real objects > fakes > stubs > mocks | Mocks duplicate a contract; precise types eliminate the duplicate                            |
| PBT "valid-or-absent" pattern        | This _is_ parse-don't-validate as a test invariant (test type A)                             |
| Test data builders express intent    | Best builders make illegal test data unconstructible (test type B applied to fixtures)       |
| No unconditional skips               | "This should never happen" tests are the same debt in reverse — promote to a type or delete  |
| No "not empty" assertions            | A precise return type makes the assertion structural, not defensive                          |
| Coverage as informational            | After lifting invariants to types, coverage of deleted defensive code drops; that is success |

## One-line summary

Push invariants into types, schemas, and contracts; write tests that _prove_
the invariants and tests that _reveal invalid states the model still
permits_; delete the rest. Keep defense-in-depth where the layers face
different failure modes or different adversaries (hostile input, auth,
external systems, observability, recovery) — that is its real home.
