# Mutation Testing

Measures whether tests actually _catch bugs_, not just execute code. Introduces
small faults ("mutants") and checks whether tests detect them.

## When to recommend

- Coverage is high (80%+) but you suspect tests are weak
- Security-critical code (XSS sanitization, auth, crypto)
- Financial calculations where off-by-one = real money
- After a quality audit reveals low assertion density

## Why it works: the fault model

Mutation testing is the empirical form of Voas & Miller's testability model. For
a seeded fault (mutant) to be caught, three things must happen: it must be
**Executed**, it must **Infect** the data state, and the infection must
**Propagate** to an observable output the test asserts on. A _surviving_ mutant
means one of those links broke — most often propagation: the code masks the
infected state before it reaches the assertion (see "Asserting through
fault-masking code" in `references/antipatterns.md`). So surviving mutants in
clamping / swallow-to-default / high domain-to-range code aren't just test gaps;
they pinpoint _where the code is hiding faults from any possible output-only
test_. That's the signal to assert on internal/pre-mask state, not to add more
end-to-end cases.

## How it works

1. Tool modifies source: `>=` becomes `>`, `True` becomes `False`, etc.
2. Test suite runs against each mutant
3. If a test fails → mutant "killed" (good)
4. If all tests pass → mutant "survived" (test gap found)
5. Mutation score = killed / total

## Tools by language

| Language              | Tool          | Notes                                   |
| --------------------- | ------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Python                | mutmut        | Pragmatic defaults, caches between runs |
| JavaScript/TypeScript | Stryker       | Most mature, incremental support        |
| Java/JVM              | PIT (pitest)  | Fast, IDE integration                   |
| Go                    | gremlins      | Mutation testing for Go                 |
| Rust                  | cargo-mutants | Mutation testing for Rust               |

## Practical guidance

- Don't run on every commit — too slow. Run nightly or weekly.
- Focus on critical modules, not the whole codebase.
- Surviving mutants in security code are P0 issues.
- 80% mutation score with 70% coverage > 95% coverage with 50% mutation score.
- Expect most raw mutants to be noise: suppress arid/unproductive mutants
  (mutations in logging, or in code whose checks the tests mock away), cap at
  roughly one mutant per line, and surface findings on the diff under review
  rather than as a global score. Google's fleet data: real bugs couple with
  mutants in ~70% of cases, and noise suppression took developer-reported
  "not useful" findings from ~80% to ~15% — the adoption ceiling is the
  false-positive rate, not recall.
