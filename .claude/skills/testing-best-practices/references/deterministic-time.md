# Deterministic Time Testing

For any code that depends on time — timers, TTLs, retry backoffs, cache
expiry, timeouts, scheduled jobs, "last seen" tracking — tests must never
depend on wall-clock time. Two strategies remove that dependence:
**virtualization** (intercept the system clock) and **injection** (pass
a clock object explicitly).

## The bug class this catches

Tests that depend on real time produce:

- `time.sleep(5)` waiting for a timer — slow AND occasionally flaky
- Assertions that pass on a fast machine but fail on a busy CI runner
- Tests that fail at midnight UTC or during DST transitions
- Cache TTL tests that pass most of the time but fire once a month

The universal rule, before any strategy: **never call real `sleep()` /
`Thread.sleep()` / `setTimeout` with real time in tests**. If you can't
remove it, your code has a time seam in the wrong place.

Triage order for a flaky test: first ask whether a smaller SUT can host it —
test size (dependencies, processes, RAM footprint) predicts flakiness better
than tool choice — then fix the specific cause (time, shared state, network,
races, ordering). Auto-retry and quarantine are masking debt, not fixes.

## Strategy 1: Process-level virtualization

Intercept the system clock without changing production code. Best when
you're retrofitting tests onto existing code, or when there's a single
clock in the system.

### Python: `freezegun` or `time-machine`

```python
from freezegun import freeze_time

@freeze_time("2024-01-15 12:00:00")
def test_cache_expiry():
    cache.set("key", "value", ttl=60)
    assert cache.get("key") == "value"
    with freeze_time("2024-01-15 12:01:01"):  # 61s later
        assert cache.get("key") is None
```

`time-machine` is faster; `freezegun` is more widely deployed.

### JavaScript/TypeScript: `vi.useFakeTimers()` / `@sinonjs/fake-timers`

```typescript
import { vi } from "vitest";

test("cache expires after TTL", () => {
  vi.useFakeTimers();
  cache.set("key", "value", { ttl: 60_000 });
  expect(cache.get("key")).toBe("value");
  vi.advanceTimersByTime(60_001);
  expect(cache.get("key")).toBeUndefined();
  vi.useRealTimers();
});
```

### Ruby: `timecop`. C/C++: `libfaketime` (LD_PRELOAD).

### When virtualization is the wrong tool

- Multiple independent clocks need to advance differently (server vs client time)
- Third-party native code calls `gettimeofday` directly and bypasses the hook
- The system under test is a library that may be embedded in any time context

Switch to injection.

## Strategy 2: Architectural injection

Pass a `Clock` object at architectural seams — the places where time enters
the system. Production uses the real clock; tests pass a controllable fake.
**Don't thread a clock through every function** — only at the seams.

### Java: built-in `java.time.Clock`

```java
public class Cache {
    private final Clock clock;
    public Cache(Clock clock) { this.clock = clock; }
    public void set(String key, V value, Duration ttl) {
        entries.put(key, new Entry(value, clock.instant().plus(ttl)));
    }
}

// Test
var fixed = Clock.fixed(Instant.parse("2024-01-15T12:00:00Z"), ZoneOffset.UTC);
var cache = new Cache(fixed);
```

### Go: `clock.Clock` interface (`clockwork` or `benbjohnson/clock`)

```go
type Cache struct { clock clockwork.Clock }

// Production
cache := &Cache{clock: clockwork.NewRealClock()}

// Test
fake := clockwork.NewFakeClock()
cache := &Cache{clock: fake}
fake.Advance(time.Minute)
```

Go's standard library has no virtualization hook, so injection is idiomatic.

### TypeScript: when sinon isn't enough

```typescript
type Now = () => number;

class Cache {
  constructor(private readonly now: Now = Date.now) {}
}

// Test with two independent clocks
let serverTime = 1_000_000;
let clientTime = 1_000_000;
const server = new Cache(() => serverTime);
const client = new Cache(() => clientTime);
serverTime += 60_000; // server advances, client doesn't — model clock skew
```

### Python: when freezegun isn't enough

```python
class Cache:
    def __init__(self, clock: Callable[[], float] = time.monotonic):
        self._clock = clock
```

### Rust: pass a trait

```rust
trait Clock { fn now(&self) -> Instant; }
```

No standard `Clock` trait yet. Define one per project or take a `fn() -> Instant`.

## Choosing between strategies

| Situation                                         | Strategy                            |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Single app, single clock, retrofit existing tests | Virtualization                      |
| New code, library author                          | Injection                           |
| Distributed system test modeling clock skew       | Injection (one clock per component) |
| Code under test uses third-party timers           | Virtualization                      |
| Test needs server time ≠ client time              | Injection                           |
| Multiple time scales (monotonic vs wall)          | Injection                           |

## Lint to keep the seam in place

Once time-dependent code is behind a seam, ban wall-clock APIs everywhere else.
A code review rule is too leaky — make it a compile-time / lint-time error.

- ESLint: `no-restricted-properties` on `Date.now`, `new Date()`, `performance.now`
- Ruff (Python): custom rule banning `time.time()`, `datetime.now()` (require explicit clock or `freeze_time`)
- Go: `golangci-lint` with `forbidigo` banning `time.Now`, `time.Since`, `time.After`
- Java: ArchUnit restricting `Instant.now()`, `System.currentTimeMillis()`
- Rust: clippy `disallowed_methods` for `Instant::now`, `SystemTime::now`

Allow the wall-clock API only inside the one module that constructs the real
clock for production.

## Rules that apply to both strategies

1. **Pin the test's starting time.** Tests using "now" become unstable across
   dates and time zones. Fix to a known instant.
2. **Advance by the exact amount needed.** Don't `advance(0.1)` "to be safe."
   If the test needs T+60s, advance exactly 60s.
3. **Watch for multiple time sources.** Server time, DB time, request
   timestamps, audit logs — each is a separate clock. Freezing one but not
   another produces confusing failures.
4. **Verify timer-fire ordering.** Advancing time by 10s with timers at 1s,
   3s, 7s should fire them in scheduled order, not all at once. Most
   virtualization libraries do this; check yours.
5. **Don't mix strategies in one test.** A test that uses `freezegun` but
   passes a real `time.time()` to a helper has two clocks. Pick one.

## What this looks like at the extreme

Jane Street's OCaml `Time_source` makes the clock an explicit parameter of
every Async API. The compiler enforces it: `open! Require_explicit_time_source`
deprecates wall-clock APIs at the type level. Tests construct independent
time sources for each component:

```ocaml
let server_time_source = Synchronous_time_source.create ~now:Time_ns.epoch ()
let client_time_source = Synchronous_time_source.create ~now:Time_ns.epoch ()
(* Advance server clock independently of client — models clock skew *)
Synchronous_time_source.advance_by_alarms_by server_time_source heartbeat_timeout
```

This is the gold standard but takes a decade-long architectural commitment.
For most projects: virtualization for existing code, injection at the few
new architectural boundaries that need independent clocks.

## When the seam isn't time: forced transitions, and guardrails

Background work that no clock drives — flush threads woken by write volume,
channel-fed merge goroutines, eviction sweeps — needs the same treatment as
time: a seam in the system under test, never a sleep. Either force the
transition synchronously (`auto_flush=False` + a `flush_now()` that runs the
_same code_ the worker runs) or expose a completion signal tests can await
deterministically (an `Event` set after each pass, a `Flush()` that blocks on
a `WaitGroup`). Expose read-only introspection (`pending_count()`) so tests
assert state instead of inferring it from timing.

Whatever the seam, these guardrails are non-negotiable:

- **Never bypass security or business rules.** A "test mode" that disables
  auth, rate limiting, or validation — especially via an environment variable
  a production deploy can set — is a vulnerability, not a seam. Make the
  clock or scheduler injectable instead, so the rule stays intact and the
  test controls what the rule observes.
- **Seams control scheduling and observation, not outcomes.** `flush_now()`
  forces _when_ work happens; it must not change _what_ the work does, and a
  separate test-only code path tests nothing.
- **Gate the surface.** Constructor parameters with safe production defaults,
  test-only build tags, or a namespaced debug surface that hardened builds
  disable.
- **Keep introspection read-only**, as a public documented contract — not
  `obj._internal` reaches that couple tests to implementation details.

## Anti-patterns

| Anti-pattern                                               | Fix                                                      |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `time.sleep(5)` waiting for a timer                        | Virtualize or inject; advance time directly              |
| `time.sleep(0.1)` "just to be safe"                        | Race condition; fix synchronization, don't paper over it |
| Hard-coded timestamps that match `now()`                   | Pin the clock first, then assert exact equality          |
| `assert abs(ts - now()) < 1`                               | Freeze time; assert exact equality                       |
| Test that depends on the day of week                       | Pin the clock to a fixed weekday                         |
| Mock the clock in one test but use real time in its helper | Mixed clocks; pick one strategy per test                 |
| Test that runs reliably only during business hours         | DST or business-hours logic uses wall clock; freeze it   |
